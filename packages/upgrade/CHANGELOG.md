[compare changes](https://github.com/LouisMazel/maz-ui/compare/v5.0.0-beta.24...v5.0.0-beta.25)

### 🚀 Features

- ⚠️ Maz-ui v5 — theming overhaul, RTL-native components, ~8% lighter ([76af016e0](https://github.com/LouisMazel/maz-ui/commit/76af016e0))

  Maz-UI v5 is a focused major: a theming overhaul on top of Tailwind v4,
  RTL-correct components, a lighter chart, a simpler icon API, and a one-shot
  CLI to make the upgrade itself painless.
  **Highlights**
  - **Theming, top to bottom** — OKLCh color system for perceptually uniform
    scales, honest token names (`background` → `surface`, `border` → `divider`),
    a real radius scale, a `components` block to override per-component tokens,
    the new `nova` preset, and preset persistence across reloads.
  - **Logical direction by default** — every `left`/`right` prop, slot and CSS
    hook is now `start`/`end`. Set `dir="rtl"` and components mirror correctly.
  - **Lighter chart** — `MazChart` drops `vue-chartjs`, lazy-loads `chart.js`,
    and only registers the modules the chart `type` actually needs.
  - **Simpler icons** — one `icon` prop instead of four. New
    `@maz-ui/icons/raw/*` subpath for raw SVG inlining without a Vue component.
  - **Standardized sizes** — `MazBadge` joins the rest of the library on the
    `MazSize` keyword scale.
  - **~8% lighter library bundle** thanks to the chart, icon and theming
    refactors.
  - Modern browsers required (Chromium 111+, Safari 16.4+, Firefox 128+).
    **Migration**
  - **Mechanical part:** `npx @maz-ui/upgrade ./` rewrites your code, bumps
    every `maz-ui` / `@maz-ui/*` entry in `package.json` to `^5.0.0`, and runs
    the right `pnpm`/`yarn`/`bun`/`npm install` for you.
  - **Judgment calls** (icon paths, theme preset reshape, chart animation
    default): connect [`@maz-ui/mcp`](https://maz-ui.com/guide/mcp) to your AI
    assistant and walk the guide section by section.

- ⚠️ Maz-ui v5 — theming overhaul, RTL-native components, ~8% lighter ([76af016e0](https://github.com/LouisMazel/maz-ui/commit/76af016e0))

  Maz-UI v5 is a focused major: a theming overhaul on top of Tailwind v4,
  RTL-correct components, a lighter chart, a simpler icon API, and a one-shot
  CLI to make the upgrade itself painless.
  **Highlights**
  - **Theming, top to bottom** — OKLCh color system for perceptually uniform
    scales, honest token names (`background` → `surface`, `border` → `divider`),
    a real radius scale, a `components` block to override per-component tokens,
    the new `nova` preset, and preset persistence across reloads.
  - **Logical direction by default** — every `left`/`right` prop, slot and CSS
    hook is now `start`/`end`. Set `dir="rtl"` and components mirror correctly.
  - **Lighter chart** — `MazChart` drops `vue-chartjs`, lazy-loads `chart.js`,
    and only registers the modules the chart `type` actually needs.
  - **Simpler icons** — one `icon` prop instead of four. New
    `@maz-ui/icons/raw/*` subpath for raw SVG inlining without a Vue component.
  - **Standardized sizes** — `MazBadge` joins the rest of the library on the
    `MazSize` keyword scale.
  - **~8% lighter library bundle** thanks to the chart, icon and theming
    refactors.
  - Modern browsers required (Chromium 111+, Safari 16.4+, Firefox 128+).
    **Migration**
  - **Mechanical part:** `npx @maz-ui/upgrade ./` rewrites your code, bumps
    every `maz-ui` / `@maz-ui/*` entry in `package.json` to `^5.0.0`, and runs
    the right `pnpm`/`yarn`/`bun`/`npm install` for you.

    default): connect [`@maz-ui/mcp`](https://maz-ui.com/guide/mcp) to your AI

- ⚠️ Maz-ui v5 — theming overhaul, RTL-native components, ~8% lighter ([78659718a](https://github.com/LouisMazel/maz-ui/commit/78659718a))

  Maz-UI v5 is a focused major: a theming overhaul on top of Tailwind v4,
  RTL-correct components, a lighter chart, a simpler icon API, and a one-shot
  CLI to make the upgrade itself painless.
  **Highlights**
  - **Theming, top to bottom** — OKLCh color system for perceptually uniform
    scales, honest token names (`background` → `surface`, `border` → `divider`),
    a real radius scale, a `components` block to override per-component tokens,
    the new `nova` preset, and preset persistence across reloads.
  - **Logical direction by default** — every `left`/`right` prop, slot and CSS
    hook is now `start`/`end`. Set `dir="rtl"` and components mirror correctly.
  - **Lighter chart** — `MazChart` drops `vue-chartjs`, lazy-loads `chart.js`,
    and only registers the modules the chart `type` actually needs.
  - **Simpler icons** — one `icon` prop instead of four. New
    `@maz-ui/icons/raw/*` subpath for raw SVG inlining without a Vue component.
  - **Standardized sizes** — `MazBadge` joins the rest of the library on the
    `MazSize` keyword scale.
  - **~8% lighter library bundle** thanks to the chart, icon and theming
    refactors.
  - Modern browsers required (Chromium 111+, Safari 16.4+, Firefox 128+).
    **Migration**
  - **Mechanical part:** `npx @maz-ui/upgrade ./` rewrites your code, bumps
    every `maz-ui` / `@maz-ui/*` entry in `package.json` to `^5.0.0`, and runs
    the right `pnpm`/`yarn`/`bun`/`npm install` for you.
  - **Judgment calls** (icon paths, theme preset reshape, chart animation
    default): connect [`@maz-ui/mcp`](https://maz-ui.com/guide/mcp) to your AI
    assistant and walk the guide section by section.
