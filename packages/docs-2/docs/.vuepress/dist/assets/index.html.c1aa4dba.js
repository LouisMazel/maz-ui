But Nuxt is designed for building applications, while VuePress is more lightweight and focused on content-centric static sites.</p><h3 id="vitepress" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vitepress" aria-hidden="true">#</a> VitePress</h3><p>VitePress is the little brother of VuePress. It&#39;s also created and maintained by our Vue.js team. It&#39;s even more lightweight and faster than VuePress. However, as a tradeoff, it&#39;s more opinionated and less configurable. For example, it does not support plugins. But VitePress is powerful enough to make your content online if you don&#39;t need advanced customizations.</p><p>It might not be an appropriate comparison, but you can take VuePress and VitePress as Laravel and Lumen.</p><h3 id="docsify-docute" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#docsify-docute" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Docsify / Docute</h3><p>Both are great projects and also Vue-powered. Except they are both fully runtime-driven and therefore not SEO-friendly. If you don\u2019t care for SEO and don\u2019t want to mess with installing dependencies, these are still great choices.</p><h3 id="hexo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hexo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Hexo</h3><p>Hexo has been serving the Vue 2.x docs well. The biggest problem is that its theming system is static and string-based - we want to take advantage of Vue for both the layout and the interactivity. Also, Hexo\u2019s Markdown rendering isn\u2019t the most flexible to configure.</p><h3 id="gitbook" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gitbook" aria-hidden="true">#</a> GitBook</h3><p>We\u2019ve been using GitBook for most of our sub project docs. The primary problem with GitBook is that its development reload performance is intolerable with a large amount of files. The default theme also has a pretty limiting navigation structure, and the theming system is, again, not Vue based. The team behind GitBook is also more focused on turning it into a commercial product rather than an open-source tool.</p>',12);function R(W,O){const o=r("ExternalLinkIcon");return a(),i(d,null,[u,t("p",null,[l,t("a",p,[_,n(o)]),f]),g,m,t("p",null,[b,t("a",w,[y,n(o)]),k,t("a",x,[V,n(o)]),v]),t("p",null,[P,t("a",j,[B,n(o)]),T]),I,t("p",null,[N,t("a",E,[H,n(o)]),M,S,L,t("a",G,[A,n(o)]),D]),F],64)}var C=s(c,[["render",R],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{C as default};
