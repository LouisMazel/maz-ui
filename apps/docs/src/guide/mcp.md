## What is MCP?

Think of MCP (Model Context Protocol) as a **smart bridge** between your AI assistant and Maz-UI. It's like giving your AI assistant a direct phone line to all of Maz-UI's documentation!

Instead of asking *"How do I use MazBtn?"* and getting generic answers or answers based on old documentation, your AI can now:
- üîç **Search** through all 50+ Maz-UI components and others
- üìñ **Read** the exact documentation for any component, composables, directives, plugins, helpers, and best practices
- üí° **Suggest** the best way to implement your needs
- üõ†Ô∏è **Help** with implementation examples

::: tip Maz-UI provides a free MCP server with access to:

- 50+ Vue components documentation
- 14+ composables and utilities
- 11 comprehensive guides
- 5 directives and 4 plugins
- 20+ helper functions

         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["@maz-ui/mcp"]
       }
